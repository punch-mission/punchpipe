Welcome to controlsegment's documentation!
==========================================


The ``controlsegment`` provides the basic tools to build a satellite data reduction pipeline using
Python and the Prefect package. Using the ``controlsegment``, users can define their own custom pipelines.
``constrolsegment`` was designed initially to support the `PUNCH mission`_; that custom pipeline
can be found in the `punchpipe repository`_.

To aid in comprehending this package, we provide a tutorial on how to set up a pipeline in `samplepipe`_.
